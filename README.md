This is a stack project, meaning you should have stack (currently better alternative to cabal) installed on your machine for everything to run properly. First try building the project by using `stack build` command from project folder. That should pull down all the necessary files (it might take a while when you try it for the first time). After build has finished try running `stack repl`. That will load all of your project files in haskell repl (a.k.a. GHCi) so that you can test individual functions. Inside this repl, by calling the Main function, local server will start running on port 8080 (maybe? it's in the code :)) from where you will be able to access most of the manga titles.
