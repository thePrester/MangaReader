# simpl

This is a stack project, meaning you should have stack (currently better alternative to cabal) installed on your machine for everything to run properly. First try building the project by using `stack build` command from project folder. That should pull down all the necessary files (it might take a while when you try it for the first time). After build has finished try running `stack repl`. That will load all of your project files in haskell repl (a.k.a. GHCi) so that you can test individual functions.
